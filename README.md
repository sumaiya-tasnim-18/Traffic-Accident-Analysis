# 🚦🚔Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization
This repository focuses on analyzing traffic accident data using Python in Jupyter Notebook to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# 📇 Project Overview
    • Dataset: Accident.csv
    • Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
    • Focus Areas: Data Cleaning, Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis, Severity Mapping, Identification of Top Accident Causes, Hotspot Analysis, and Visualizations including Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, and Annotated Charts

# ╰┈➤ 📝 Steps Breakdown
    • Explored and cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, removed duplicates, verified data types, and mapped numeric severity to categorical labels (Minor, Serious, Fatal).
    • Performed Univariate Analysis: Accident severity distribution, Weather condition counts.
    • Performed Bivariate Analysis: Weather vs Accident severity, Road surface vs Weather conditions.
    • Performed Multivariate Analysis: Combined effect of Road surface, Weather, Junction type, and Causes of Accidents on severity using annotated bar charts and scatter plots.
    • Identified top 10 causes of accidents and distribution by junction type.
    • Visualized accident hotspots by junction type and cause with bubble scatter plots indicating severity.
    • Annotated all key charts to clearly highlight accident patterns and insights.

# 🎯 Outcome
The project delivered a fully cleaned dataset, comprehensive exploratory analysis, and clear visualizations highlighting key accident patterns. It identifies how weather, road surface, and junction type influence accident occurrence and severity, and provides actionable insights for traffic safety planning.
